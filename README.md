# FaceSwapLab for a1111/Vlad

V1.2.3 : Breaking change for settings, please read changelog.

Please read the documentation here : https://glucauze.github.io/sd-webui-faceswaplab/

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for changes in last versions.

FaceSwapLab is an extension for Stable Diffusion that simplifies face-swapping. It has evolved from sd-webui-faceswap and some part of sd-webui-roop. However, a substantial amount of the code has been rewritten to improve performance and to better manage masks.

Some key features include the ability to reuse faces via checkpoints, multiple face units, batch process images, sort faces based on size or gender, and support for vladmantic. It also provides a face inpainting feature.

While FaceSwapLab is still under development, it has reached a good level of stability. This makes it a reliable tool for those who are interested in face-swapping within the Stable Diffusion environment. As with all projects of this type, it’s expected to improve and evolve over time.

### Known problems (wontfix):

+ Older versions of gradio don't work well with the extension. See this bug : https://github.com/glucauze/sd-webui-faceswaplab/issues/5

## Quick Start

Here are some gifs to explain (non cherry picked, just random pictures) : 

## Simple Usage (roop like)

This use codeformer on all faces (including non swapped)

[simple.webm](https://github.com/glucauze/sd-webui-faceswaplab/assets/137925069/de00b685-d441-44f9-bae3-71cd7abef113)

## Advanced options 

This is use to improve results. This use upscaling and codeformer only on swapped faces

[advanced.webm](https://github.com/glucauze/sd-webui-faceswaplab/assets/137925069/50630311-bd25-487f-871b-0a44eecd435d)

## Inpainting 

This add inpainting on faces : 

[inpainting.webm](https://github.com/glucauze/sd-webui-faceswaplab/assets/137925069/3d3508e9-5be4-4566-8c41-8301b2d08355)

## Build and use checkpoints : 

[build.webm](https://github.com/glucauze/sd-webui-faceswaplab/assets/137925069/e84e9a3c-840d-4536-9fbb-09ed256406d7)



### Simple

1. Put a face in the reference.
2. Select a face number.
3. Select "Enable."
4. Select "CodeFormer" in **Global Post-Processing** tab.

Once you're happy with some results but want to improve, the next steps are to:

+ Use advanced settings in face units (which are not as complex as they might seem, it's basically fine tuning post-processing for each faces).
+ Use pre/post inpainting to tweak the image a bit for more natural results.

### Better 

1. Put a face in the reference.
2. Select a face number.
3. Select "Enable."

4. In **Post-Processing** accordeon:
    + Select "CodeFormer" 
    + Select "LDSR" or a faster model "003_realSR_BSRGAN_DFOWMFC_s64w8_SwinIR-L_x4_GAN" in upscaler. See [here for a list of upscalers](https://github.com/glucauze/sd-webui-faceswaplab/discussions/29). 
    + Use sharpen, color_correction and improved mask

5. Disable "CodeFormer" in **Global Post-Processing** tab (otherwise it will be applied twice)

Don't hesitate to share config in the [discussion section](https://github.com/glucauze/sd-webui-faceswaplab/discussions).

### Features

+ **Face Unit Concept**: Similar to controlNet, the program introduces the concept of a face unit. You can configure up to 10 units (3 units are the default setting) in the program settings (sd).

+ **Vladmantic and a1111 Support**

+ **Batch Processing**

+ **GPU**

+ **Inpainting Fixes** : supports “only masked” and mask inpainting.

+ **Performance Improvements**: The overall performance of the software has been enhanced.

+ **FaceSwapLab Tab**: providing various tools (build, compare, extract, batch)

+ **FaceSwapLab Settings**: FaceSwapLab settings are now part of the sd settings. To access them, navigate to the sd settings section.

+ **Face Reuse Via Checkpoints**: The FaceTools tab now allows creating checkpoints, which facilitate face reuse. When a checkpoint is used, it takes precedence over the reference image, and the reference source image is discarded.

+ **Gender Detection**: The program can now detect gender based on faces.

+ **Face Combination (Blending)**: Multiple versions of a face can be combined to enhance the swapping result. This blending happens during checkpoint creation.)

+ **Preserve Original Images**: You can opt to keep original images before the swapping process.

+ **Multiple Face Versions for Replacement**: The program allows the use of multiple versions of the same face for replacement.

+ **Face Similarity and Filtering**: You can compare faces against the reference and/or source images.

+ **Face Comparison**: face comparison feature.

+ **Face Extraction**: face extraction with or without upscaling.

+ **Improved Post-Processing**: codeformer, gfpgan, upscaling.

+ **Post Inpainting**: This feature allows the application of image-to-image inpainting specifically to faces.

+ **Upscaled Inswapper**: The program now includes an upscaled inswapper option, which improves results by incorporating upsampling, sharpness adjustment, and color correction before face is merged to the original image.

+ **API with typing support**
