## Requirements/Recommanded configuration

The extension runs mainly on the CPU to avoid the use of VRAM. However, it is recommended to follow the specifications recommended by sd/a1111 with regard to prerequisites. At the time of writing, a version of python lower than 11 is preferable (even if it works with python 3.11, model loading and performance may fall short of expectations).

Older versions of gradio donâ€™t work well with the extension. See this bug report : https://github.com/glucauze/sd-webui-faceswaplab/issues/5. It has been tested on 3.32.0

### Windows-User : Visual Studio ! Don't neglect this !

Before beginning the installation process, if you are using Windows, you need to install this requirement:

1. Install Visual Studio 2022: This step is required to build some of the dependencies. You can use the Community version of Visual Studio 2022, which can be downloaded from the following link: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

2. OR Install only the VS C++ Build Tools: If you don't need the full Visual Studio suite, you can choose to install only the VS C++ Build Tools. During the installation process, select the option for "Desktop Development with C++" found under the "Workloads -> Desktop & Mobile" section. The VS C++ Build Tools can be downloaded from this link: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

3. OR if you don't want to install either the full Visual Studio suite or the VS C++ Build Tools: Follow the instructions provided in section VIII of the documentation.

## SD.Next / Vladmantic

SD.Next loading optimizations in relation to extension installation scripts can sometimes cause problems. This is particularly the case if you copy the script without installing it via the interface.

If you get an error after startup, try restarting the server.

**You may need to restart sd once the installation process is complete.**

On first launch, templates are downloaded, which may take some time. All models are located in the `models/faceswaplab` folder.

If you encounter the error `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'`, take the following steps:

1. Download the [inswapper_128.onnx](https://huggingface.co/henryruhs/faceswaplab/resolve/main/inswapper_128.onnx) model.
2. Place the downloaded model inside the `<webui_dir>/models/faceswaplab/` directory.
