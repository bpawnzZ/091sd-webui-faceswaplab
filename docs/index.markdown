FaceSwapLab is an extension for Stable Diffusion that simplifies the use of [insighface models](https://insightface.ai/) for face-swapping. It has evolved from sd-webui-faceswap and some part of sd-webui-roop. However, a substantial amount of the code has been rewritten to improve performance and to better manage masks.

Some key [features](features) include the ability to reuse faces via checkpoints, multiple face units, batch process images, sort faces based on size or gender, and support for vladmantic. It also provides a face inpainting feature.

While FaceSwapLab is still under development, it has reached a good level of stability. This makes it a reliable tool for those who are interested in face-swapping within the Stable Diffusion environment. As with all projects of this type, it's expected to improve and evolve over time.

### Ethical Guideline

This extension is **not intended to facilitate the creation of not safe for work (NSFW) or non-consensual deepfake content**. Its purpose is to bring consistency to image creation, making it easier to repair existing images, or bring characters back to life.

We will comply with European regulations regarding this type of software. As required by law, the code may include both visible and invisible watermarks. If your local laws prohibit the use of this extension, you should not use it.

From an ethical perspective, the main goal of this extension is to generate consistent images by swapping faces. It's important to note that we've done our best to integrate censorship features. However, when users can access the source code, they might bypass these censorship measures. That's why we urge users to use this extension responsibly and avoid any malicious use. We emphasize the importance of respecting people's privacy and consent when swapping faces in images. We discourage any activities that could harm others, invade their privacy, or negatively affect their well-being.

Additionally, we believe it's important to make the public aware of these tools and the ease with which deepfakes can be created. As technology improves, we need to be more critical and skeptical when we encounter media content. By promoting media literacy, we can reduce the negative impact of misusing these tools and encourage responsible use in the digital world.
